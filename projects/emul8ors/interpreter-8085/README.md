# interpreter-8085
A simple (work in progress) interpreter based intel 8085 emulator.

Refer [the programming syntax](doc/ProgramSyntax.md) to understand how to write a human-readable assembly file for this emulator, and [the instruction decoding logic](doc/InstructionDecodeLogic.md) (to be implemented) for how the instructions are executed at runtime.
